### Project
This dataset contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb), including user ratings and revenue and starting at year 1966. As a movie enthusiast, I am interested in exploring how the audience vote on movies over the years. This project is inspired by Youtube videos explaining "why modern movies are bad", arguing that the quality and creativity are deteriorating.

### Packages Used
In this project, I will be suing data obtained from kaggle to answer questions about the Database. I used numpy, pandas, matplotlib, along with the data file 'tmdb-movies.csv'.
