## Project Overview
In this project, I gathered data from the archives of a Twitter account called [WeRateDogs](https://twitter.com/dog_rates) which rates owned dogs in their tweets and adds a humorous comment with it. My primary goal for this project is to practice the data analysis process, specifically the wrangling data phase. Here are some steps I took:
~~~~~
- Gathered retweet and like counts for all the tweets from the Twitter API using the access library tweepy 
- Read the data into a pandas dataframe in the Jupyter Notebook. 
- Downloaded a tsv file about the tweets programmatically using the requests and BeautifulSoup libraries in python. 
- Assessed quality and tidiness issues in the gathered datasets and cleaned all of them using pandas functions. 
- Analyzed the cleaned tables and created visualizations using the matplotlib library.
